# iota_microgrid - IN PROGRESS

This repository contains the code for the proposed microgrid based on IOTA
Distributed Ledger Technology. Detailed explanation can be found at *url*.

## General description
The simulator is based on IOTA + python libraries. All communication between
agents are done based on the Tangle. Required libraries and versions can be
found in *requirements.txt*. They can be installed locally, but the recomendation
is to do it using a virtual environment.

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The main file for the simulator execution is organized_tests.ipynb, but the
code can be re-arranged.

Pull requests are welcome.
